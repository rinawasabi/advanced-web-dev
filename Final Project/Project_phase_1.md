# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

## Backgound story
Upon developing this application, there were several reasons why I decided to implement this project.

First, I wanted to improve my understanding of full-stack development, especially using Node.js, SQLite, and React.

Secondly, I enjoy cooking and thought it would be meaningful and fun to create an application that allows people to share their favorite recipes.

Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself by building a fully functional CRUD application from scratch.

### Project Management

This project is implemented solely. As this project has 4 phases, they were divded as follows.
This might slightly change as assignments and exams of other courses might interfare.

**Phase 1 - Definition and Planning (Week 13-14)**


**Phase 2 - Basic structure and main functionalities (Week 15-16)**


**Phase 3 - Advanced features and optimization (Week 17-18)**


**Phase 4 - Refinement & Presentation (Week 19-20)**


Some of the risks of this project should be noted.
- **Falling behind schedule**
  There is a risk that the project might fall behind schedule. To mitigate this,
  I should work as much as possible when I have time. I should also ask for guidance from the teacher and classmates.
- **Overwork**
  Since this project is being completely individually, there is no opportunity to share
  the workload, increasing the risk of overwork. To prevent burnout, I should establish
  clear boundaries between work and personal time, ensuring that I maintain a
  healthy work-life balance.
