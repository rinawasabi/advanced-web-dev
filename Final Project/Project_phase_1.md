Upon developing this application, there were several reasons why I decided to implement this project.

First, I wanted to improve my understanding of full-stack development, especially using Node.js, SQLite, and React.

Secondly, I enjoy cooking and thought it would be meaningful and fun to create an application that allows people to share their favorite recipes.

"Maku" means flavor in Finnish. so...

### Project Management

This project is implemented solely. As this project has 4 phases, they were divded as follows.
The inital schedule might slightly change as assignments and exams of other courses might interfare.

**Phase 1 - Definition and Planning (Week 13-14)**
- Defining the user personas, use cases and flow of the application.
- Implementing the initlal UI design using Figma (wireframes, layout, color scheme).
- Planning Information Architecture and Technical Design??
- Planning the oveall schedule for the project and user testing of the application.

**Phase 2 - Basic structure and main functionalities (Week 15-16)**
- a
- a
- a

**Phase 3 - Advanced features and optimization (Week 17-18)**

**Phase 4 - Refinement & Presentation (Week 19-20)**
- Debugging minor issues.
- Checking and verifying the overall functions.
- Improving UI if possible.
- Preparing materials for the presentation (e.g., slides, demo, README). 

Some of the risks of this project should be noted.
- **Falling behind schedule**:
  There is a risk that the project might fall behind schedule. To mitigate this, I should work as much as possible when I have time. I should also ask for guidance     from the teacher and classmates.
  
- **Overwork**:
  As this project is undertaken entirely solo, there’s no possibility to divide the workload, which raises the chance of overworking. To avoid burnout, it’s crucial    to set firm boundaries between professional responsibilities and personal time, enabling a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
