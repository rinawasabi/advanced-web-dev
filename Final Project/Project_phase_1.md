# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

Upon developing this application, there were several reasons why I decided to implement this project.

First, I wanted to improve my understanding of full-stack development, especially using Node.js, SQLite, and React.
Secondly, I enjoy cooking and thought it would be meaningful and fun to create an application that allows people to share their favorite recipes.
Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself by building a fully functional CRUD application from scratch.
